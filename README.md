## SF TechWeek 2025 – MCP Roast

To celebrate SF TechWeek, I’m running a pop‑up “MCP Roast” in the Bay Area:
- Bring your startup idea.  I’ll roast your current architecture while live‑coding a production‑ready remote MCP server for you in 15 minutes, or coffee is on me.
- Exclusive & free: This experiment is free during SF TechWeek, it’s my way of showing what I do best: shipping platforms fast
- Book follow‑ups: If you like what you see, you can book a 90‑minute platform workshop (get a 14‑day path to prod) or a 2–4 week strike engagement (fixed‑scope audit/hardening).
  Send an email to glo [at] sanscourier.ai for details

## Quick Facts
-	Track record: Five exits as engineer/advisor — Yammer → Microsoft for $1.2 B, Nextdoor (IPO), Do.com → Amazon, Gixo → OpenFit and Must Win → Lyric.
-	Scale: As an SRE at Nextdoor in 2020 I scaled the company’s global infrastructure by 200 % in two months during the COVID‑19 surge
-	Push‑notifications: At Yammer I built a push notification system that handled over a billion events per second, reducing delivery time from ~10 seconds to 80 ms
-	Dev tools (via Akava): At Oracle I created their first Terraform providers for Baremetal; at Cisco I shipped a 100 % open‑source Heroku‑like platform designed to be compatible both with Kubernetes and Mesos.
